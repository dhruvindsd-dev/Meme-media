## Features : 
Create a social media type of thing where the users can come login, create,upload  and download memes and see the different memes created by different users . They can also upvote and downvote a meme something like reddit . You can browse memes from hashtags, and can also see the different uploaded by different users by going to their profile . 

Create an authentication page where users can login and signup . 
Create a meme page where the user can create a new meme . (Search for image editing codepens and convert existing logic into angular ). 
Upvote and downvote on memes .
Something similar to a instagram feed where users can see other peoples memes and upvote and downvote them 
Meme creation and uploading to backend logic. 
Hashtags logic (users can search hashtags , most probably will ditch this since it is very complex .)

Login and meme creation is the main goal of our project if in case other functionality is broken or by chance we can't do it just submit the barebones.
